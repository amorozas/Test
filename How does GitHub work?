#I actually don't know how to code
#Just trying to understand the ecosystem of GitHub to continue with our project study regarding developer engagement in crypto L1 ecosystems
#We want to focus on Solana first and find out:
#- What are the best ways to measure developer engagement for the Solana ecosystem
#- Can we identify a correlation between developer activities and ecosystem value
#- Can we build a tool which then gives indication in advance of potential value increases, if there is a correlation
